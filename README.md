# Yelp-users
Answering the question: Are Elite-Yelp Users More Indicative of the Crowd than Non-Elite Yelp Users? Does it Vary by Geographic Region or Top-Level Category.

This was a project for Big Data at San Jose State University. Originally using PySpark SQL in Jupyter Notebook on Databricks Community.
There has been very little changed from what was turned in, just some bug fixes from the migration to git from databricks.
